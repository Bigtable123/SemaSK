In order to get a test set, I need you to help me write query questions based on the information I provide. In particular, I am asking to think of some questions that are difficult to answer with traditional keyword matching techniques, but are conveniently solved by the semantic techniques of the large language model, such as Find Japanese restaurants in Center City that offer a variety of sushi options, a query in which Japanese restaurants and sushi in this query can be easily solved by keyword matching, but a variety of options may require semantic techniques, and I need questions that are best solved only by semantic techniques. Also, please don't mention any location information in the query!\n",
